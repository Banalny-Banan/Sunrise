If you have missing dependencies you need to add the `EXILED_REFERENCES` environment variable 
pointing to `...\steamapps\common\SCP Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server\SCPSL_Data\Managed`.

To add the variable use this guide: [How to set an environment variable](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-set-an-environment-variable.html).
To find the `SCP Secret Laboratory Dedicated Server` directory you can use steam: [How to access game files](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760447682).

We will be actively reviewing pull requests, but itâ€™s better to discuss changes before starting to work on them.
